# Tutorials: Learn and Explore Responsibly

**üî¥ VERY IMPORTANT: ETHICAL CONDUCT AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE NOTICE üî¥**

The information and tutorials linked or contained within this repository are intended for **EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**.

*   **ALWAYS ACT ETHICALLY AND LEGALLY:** The knowledge of security vulnerabilities and system workings should be used to build, defend, and test systems **with explicit, written authorization**.
*   **NO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS:** Attempting to access, modify, or disrupt any computer system or network without permission is illegal in most jurisdictions and can lead to severe penalties.
*   **FOCUS ON LABS & AUTHORIZED TESTING:** Practice these concepts in your own controlled lab environment, on systems you own, or as part of legitimate, authorized security testing engagements (e.g., bug bounty programs within scope, penetration tests with a signed contract).
*   **RESPONSIBILITY:** You are solely responsible for your actions. Misuse of this information can cause harm and have serious consequences.

**This repository aims to foster learning and understanding. Please use the knowledge gained responsibly.**

## General Technology & Radio Exploration

These tutorials explore various aspects of technology and radio signals. Remember to always comply with local regulations regarding radio transmissions.

1.  **Exploring Radio Frequencies: Listening to Various Signals (including "Garbage" noise)**
    *   Link: [Listen to garbage and any other radio signals.md](https://github.com/muneebwanee/Tutorials/blob/main/Listen-to-garbage-and-any-other-radio-signals.md)
    *   *Note: Focus on the technical aspects of SDR and signal identification. Ensure any transmission activities are legal and licensed.*

## Ethical Hacking & Security Testing Scenarios

This section contains walkthroughs of simulated security scenarios. **These are intended for practice in controlled lab environments or on explicitly authorized systems only.**

### Web Application Security Case Studies (Inspired by @NafisiAslH's Work & Common Vulnerability Patterns)

These detailed guides walk through simulated scenarios, from initial reconnaissance to vulnerability exploitation, emphasizing the thought process and techniques used in ethical security assessments. **Always ensure you have explicit permission before testing any system you do not own.**

1.  **Admin Panel Compromise: Leveraging Archived Credentials from "Out-of-Scope" Simulated Assets**
    *   Link: [Admin_Panel_Access_via_Archived_Credentials_from_Out-of-Scope_Domain.md](https://github.com/muneebwanee/Tutorials/blob/main/Admin_Panel_Access_via_Archived_Credentials_from_Out-of-Scope_Domain.md)
    *   *Summary: Demonstrates how information leakage from supposedly unrelated or older systems (simulated as "out-of-scope" in a lab) can lead to the compromise of an in-scope protected admin panel due to credential reuse or shared configurations.*

2.  **Unveiling PII: The Impact of Django Debug Mode Misconfiguration**
    *   Link: [From_Django_Debug_Mode_to_PII_Data_Leak.md](https://github.com/muneebwanee/Tutorials/blob/main/From_Django_Debug_Mode_to_PII_Data_Leak.md)
    *   *Summary: A step-by-step simulation showing how an enabled Django Debug mode can inadvertently expose sensitive configurations, URL patterns, or directly lead to information disclosure, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII).*

3.  **Chain Reaction: From Reconnaissance to RCE - A Multi-Vulnerability Scenario**
    *   Link: [Recon_to_RCE_-_A_Cascade_of_Vulnerabilities.md](https://github.com/muneebwanee/Tutorials/blob/main/Recon_to_RCE_-_A_Cascade_of_Vulnerabilities.md)
    *   *Summary: Simulates a multi-stage attack where initial subdomain discovery leads to PII leaks, authentication bypasses, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and ultimately Remote Code Execution (RCE) via an unrestricted file upload, showcasing how vulnerabilities can be chained.*

4.  **Tomcat Takeover: Default Credentials to Remote Code Execution**
    *   Link: [Default_Tomcat_Credentials_to_RCE.md](https://github.com/muneebwanee/Tutorials/blob/main/Default_Tomcat_Credentials_to_RCE.md)
    *   *Summary: Illustrates a classic attack path where default or weak credentials on an Apache Tomcat Manager interface are exploited to deploy a malicious WAR file, resulting in RCE on the server.*

*(Note: The original list had "Admin_Panel_Access_via_Archived_Credentials_from_Out-of-Scope_Domain.md" twice. It's included once here. If the fifth item from your list was a different unique scenario, please provide its title/filename.)*

## Operating System & Pentesting Tools

Guides related to setting up environments for security testing and learning.

1.  **Creating a Portable Pentesting Environment: Kali Linux Live USB Guide**
    *   Link: [How To Install Kali Linux as a Portable Live USB for Pen-Testing & Hacking on Any Computer.md](https://github.com/muneebwanee/Tutorials/blob/main/How-To-Install-Kali-Linux%20-as-a-Portable-Live-USB-for-Pen-Testing-%26-Hacking-on-Any-Computer.md)
    *   *Note: Emphasize that using pentesting tools should always be done ethically and on authorized systems.*

# This Method will show you how you can get a free Windows 10 RDP with 7GB Ram, 2.60GHz CPU, 270GB Storage and 500Mbit/s Internet speed.

## What you are going to need:
### A device with an internet connection
### E-Mail Address (Do NOT use Tempmail)
### RDP Files (Download link is below) Alright, let’s begin.

## Alright, let’s begin.

#### First, you need to create a NEW GitHub account. I recommend using a NEW account because if it gets suspended, you won’t be losing your important data. Go to this link and click “Sign Up” on the top right corner: GitHub Sign Up

#### Remember your username and do NOT use Tempmail otherwise your account will be

#### After you have signed up, you need to download the RDP Files. Go to https://uptobox.com/8e0ezjodx9rh OR https://anonfiles.com/fdHe31C2qe/RDP-Files_zip (Support Me, Please!)

#### After the download, create a Public GitHub Repository. To do that, click on the “+” icon in the top right corner and then click on “New repository”.

#### Now you need to choose the repository name. This is very important. I recommend choosing a random name. Do NOT use something like this “RDP-Windows-GitHub”. GitHub will find your repository in a few hours and they will ban your account. After you have chosen your Repository name, make sure to save it somewhere. Write it down or put it in a text file. Do NOT make spelling mistakes. Now make sure the Repository is set to “Public” and then click Create repository

#### Now you need to edit the RDP Files. Locate the RDP Files you downloaded and open “RDP-US.yml”. You need to edit Line 15, 26, 27 and 28. Replace “YourUsername” with your GitHub username and “YourRepository” with your GitHub repository name. Make sure to type it correctly, otherwise you will get an error. Save the “RDP-US.yml” file.

#### Go to your Repository and upload the “Files” folder. Do NOT upload the whole “RDPFiles” folder. Only the “Files” folder inside of “RDP-Files”.

#### After you have done that, go to the Settings of the Repository. Under “Settings”, go to “Secrets” and click on “New repository secret”.

#### VERY IMPORTANT: Enter this in “Name”: NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN

#### Now you need to Sign Up on Ngrok. Use this link to sign up: Ngrok Sign Up Enter your username, E-Mail and password and solve the captcha if it’s there. Click sign up. Now go to “Your Authtoken” on the left side and copy the Token. Paste the token on GitHub in “Value” and click “Add secret”.

#### You are almost finished

#### Open your Repository and go to “Actions” and you will see some workflows you can use. Choose the “Simple workflow” and click “Set up this workflow”. Now you have to open the “RDP-US.yml” file and copy the text. Paste it in GitHub and your file name should be “blank.yml”. Set the name of the file to “RDP-US.yml”. Make sure to spell it correctly. Now click “Start commit” and then click on “Commit new file”.

#### Go back to “Actions” and click on “CI”. Now click on “Run workflow”. Wait 3 seconds and refresh the page. After you refreshed the page, click on “CI” again but this time, click the “CI” in the middle, not on the side. Now click on “build” and wait for your RDP to start. It should take about 1-2 Minutes.

#### Click on “Connect to your RDP 2core-7GB Ram.” and you will see the required iPAddress, Username and Password.

### ### Use those to log in and Enjoy!

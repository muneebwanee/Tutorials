### Requirements:

**ðŸ’  Port Scanner (I use zenmap in this tutorial)**

**ðŸ’  Web Browser (I use Google Chrome)**

**First of all I want to tell you why I use Zenmap because Nmap is the best friend of hackers and Zenmap is the graphical user interface of nmap.**

### Step by Step How to Randomly Hack a Home Routers

**Step 1: We should select an IP range. I have selected IP range that includes my public IP address.**
XXX.XXX.30.0-XXX.XXX.30.255

**Step 2: Now let's scan for home routers.When you finished your scan, You can find IP addresses which has open ports such as http port(80), ftp port(21) and telnet port(23).**

**Step 3: Now you can access these addesses using your web browser because http port is opened and we need to find whether the web page is router log in page.**

**Step 4: If you see the alert error messages, it says TD-8817. So we can Google for it search "TD-8817 default username and password"**

**Step 5: Now let's try to access these IP addresses using default logins we just got on step 4.**

#### Default username and passwords are not same for every routers.
